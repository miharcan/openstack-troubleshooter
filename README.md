# Grounded ReAct Framework

A production-grade **retrieval-grounded reasoning framework** built on a
full:

**ingest → index → retrieve → reason** pipeline.

This system implements a deterministic ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent
that uses official documentation as its single source of truth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Core Use Case: OpenStack Troubleshooting

The primary real-world implementation of this framework is **OpenStack
infrastructure diagnostics**.

It is capable of:

-   Troubleshooting Nova scheduler failures
-   Diagnosing Placement synchronization issues
-   Explaining Neutron networking misconfigurations
-   Resolving cross-service allocation errors
-   Performing multi-service reasoning across Nova ↔ Neutron ↔ Placement

OpenStack serves as a complex, multi-service validation environment
proving the framework's ability to reason across distributed
infrastructure systems.

## 🧠 Framework Capabilities

### 1️⃣ Structured Ingestion

-   Fetch official documentation (HTML, JSON, release notes, admin
    guides)
-   Normalize into chunked, indexed format
-   Preserve service metadata for cross-service reasoning

### 2️⃣ Deterministic Semantic Retrieval

-   FAISS vector search
-   Service-aware ranking
-   Lexical + semantic hybrid boosting
-   Multi-service detection
-   Cross-service evidence grouping

### 3️⃣ ReAct Agent Execution

-   Explicit Thought → Action → Observation → Final loop
-   Tool-restricted reasoning
-   Strict grounding (no hallucinated configs)
-   Multi-hop retrieval capability
-   Cross-service causal explanation enforcement

## 🌍 Framework-Agnostic by Design

Although OpenStack is the primary validated use case, the architecture
is fully adaptable to:

-   Kubernetes
-   Terraform
-   AWS / Azure / GCP
-   Internal enterprise platforms
-   API documentation repositories
-   Large Git-based knowledge bases

If documentation can be ingested and indexed, the system can reason over
it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Design Principles

-   Deterministic behavior over "creative" LLM output
-   Evidence-first explanations
-   Strict retrieval grounding
-   Explicit reasoning trace
-   Framework neutrality
-   Scalable multi-service reasoning

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔥 What This Is Not

This is **not** a generic chatbot over documents.

It is a structured reasoning engine with:

-   Controlled tool access
-   Retrieval validation
-   Evidence formatting
-   Causal cross-service explanation logic

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Versioning

Current evolution stage:

**v0.6 --- Multi-Service Retrieval Intelligence**

Next milestone:

**v0.7 --- Iterative Multi-Hop Cross-Service Reasoning**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Vision

To provide a production-grade, documentation-grounded reasoning engine
for diagnosing complex distributed systems with full transparency and
zero hallucinated explanations.
